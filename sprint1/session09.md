    - Empathize - Sprint 1
    - Define - Sprint 1
    - Ideate - Sprint 1
    - Prototype - Sprint 2 (review)
    - Test - Sprint 3
    - Implement - Sprint 4 (final) 
- Suggested Sprint 1 Backlog by KEK
    1. As an individual, I will interact with and learn the AI system to create basic techical competence for the team effort. (video?)
    2. As a team, we will define problem statement to be satisfied by system design. (Design Thinking)
    3. As a team, we will ideate to investigate and present potential AI system solutions. (Design Thinking)
    4. As a team, we will select an AI system solution.
    5. As a team, we will procure required components and resources.

- Presentation/Activiteis
    - Stage 1 - Empathize
        - In Design Thinking, empathy is, as explained in IDEO’s Human-Centred Design Toolkit, a “deep understanding of the problems and realities of the people you are designing for”. 
        - [Empathise with Your Users](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/stage-1-in-the-design-thinking-process-empathise-with-your-users){:target="_blank"}
        - A student viewing/interacting with the AI display case
            - needs
            - desires
            - environment
            - roles
            - interactions
            - play/fun
            - difficulties
    - Stage 2 - [Define the Problem](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/stage-2-in-the-design-thinking-process-define-the-problem-and-interpret-the-results?fbclid=IwAR145nyOICS9yoXguhnHSzGROT4uvp0LbfHy_btOaQflXTy-D5F5TAZbjOc){:target="_blank"}
        - A Point Of view (POV) is a meaningful and actionable problem statement, which will allow you to ideate in a goal-oriented manner.
        - [User . . . (descriptive)] needs [need . . . (verb)] because [insight. . . (compelling)]
        - “How Might We” or “in what ways might we”. How Might We (HMW) questions are questions that have the potential to spark ideation sessions such as brainstorms. *They should be broad enough for a wide range of solutions*, but narrow enough that specific solutions can be created for them. 
    - Ideate - What are possible solutions
        - Activity
        - Report out

        - Crazy 8s
            -Crazy 8s can be used anytime you want to come up with a bunch of ideas quickly. The simplicity of this one is wonderful:
                - Grab a piece of paper and fold it into eight sections
                - Set a timer for 8 minutes
                - Have participants sketch a distinct idea in each section.
