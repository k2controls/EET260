    - Empathize - Sprint 1
    - Define - Sprint 1
    - Ideate - Sprint 1
    - Prototype - Sprint 2 (review)
    - Test - Sprint 3
    - Implement - Sprint 4 (final)
- Backlog discussion and definition for Sprints
    - Sprint 1 (kek suggestion)
        1. As an individual, I will interact with and learn the AI system to create basic techical competence for the team effort. (video?)
        2. As a team, we will define problem statement to be satisfied by system design. (Design Thinking)
        3. As a team, we will ideate to investigate and present potential AI system solutions. (Design Thinking)
        4. As a team, we will select an AI system solution.
        5. As a team, we will procure required components and resources.
    - Sprint 2 (kek suggestion)
        1. As an individual, I will demonstrate AI system capabilities to verify technical competence. (video?)
        2. As a team, we will demonstrate AI system software required for our solution.
        3. As a team, we will construct a prototype or mock-up of the final system. (Design Thinging)
        4. As a team, we will present and submit documentation of project status to project stakeholders. (Testing - Design Thinking)
